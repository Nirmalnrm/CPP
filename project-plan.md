# Project Plan — C++ Capture The Flag Agent

**Modules:** Software Engineering and Research Project  
**Institution:** West Saxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau (WHZ)  
**Team:** Aiswarya Payakkal Vinayan and Nirmal Mohan  
**Project repository:** [cpp-agent-project](https://github.fh-zwickau.de/aip25p5h/cpp-agent-project)  
**Planning period:** 19 October 2026 – 31 January 2027  

## 1. Project Background and Problem

The team develops a Windows C++ agent DLL for the professor-provided **Capture The Flag** graphical host. The host calls the supplied API, gives the agent a **5 × 5 local observation** and requests one action per turn. The existing random and SafeMovementAgent baselines demonstrate DLL integration and local obstacle filtering, but are not reliable exploration or winning strategies.

**Competition clarification (reported during Week 4):** The competition map is not disclosed to our agent before a match, and another team's agent participates. We must therefore develop a policy that **generalizes to unseen maps**, explores under partial observation, pursues observed objectives and reacts to visible opponents. We should not assume the full map or hidden opponent state is available.

Software Engineering provides the host-compatible agents and test harnesses; Research studies exploration/pathfinding, designs fair experiments and analyzes whether the proposed strategy helps. This is a **revised proposal**, not evidence that the competitive agent has already been implemented.

## 2. Objectives and Expected Results

1. Maintain a host-compatible C++ agent DLL and the five required API exports.
2. Verify movement legality, failed-move behavior, flag interaction rules and useful opponent information.
3. Introduce conservative movement-state tracking and safe fallback before relying on persistent global coordinates.
4. Develop **Frontier-Based Exploration (FBE)** for unknown maps after position-confidence validation; use **safe local novelty exploration** as the always-available fallback.
5. Introduce a **Finite-State Machine (FSM)** for exploration, flag pickup/delivery, known-goal pursuit, visible-opponent response and recovery; use **BFS** to travel along known traversable routes. Keep **A*** optional.
6. Investigate opponent-aware responses based on visible evidence and confirmed rules.
7. Compare random, safe, exploration and hybrid policies across varied development maps and held-out unseen maps.
8. Deliver traceable source, tests, research analysis, diary and final report.

**Expected result:** a robust, documented competition-oriented agent and evidence-based experimental report. Match success and algorithm superiority are **research goals**, not current achievements.

## 3. Scope and Boundaries

**In scope:** supplied host/DLL API compatibility; local snapshot decoding; safe movement; movement-outcome and state verification; exploration under unknown maps; remembered map where consistent; BFS over known cells; observed flag and opponent behavior; controlled tests against baseline agents and multiple map layouts; documentation.

**Out of scope:** changing the supplied host or `agent_api.h`, obtaining the secret competition layout, using hidden opponent state unavailable through the API, developing a replacement GUI, or guaranteeing victory. A* and incremental search remain optional research comparisons.

See [Project Requirements](project-requirements.md) and [Week 4 Competition Strategy](week4-competition-strategy.md).

## 4. Development and Project Management Approach

We propose an **iterative and incremental software development model** supported by a **lightweight Kanban workflow in GitHub Issues**. Instead of waiting until all navigation features are implemented, the team will keep a working DLL, add one improvement at a time, and test it before the next change.

The recurring development cycle is:

**Plan → Design → Implement → Test → Evaluate → Review and update the backlog.**

We will track work using **To Do / In Progress / Review / Done** issue states (or equivalent GitHub labels/board columns). Each task should identify its work package, owner, deliverable, dependency and review evidence. Relevant code/document changes should be committed with descriptive messages; larger changes should be reviewed through a pull request where practical.

The **Gantt chart** describes the overall timetable and cross-stream dependencies; GitHub Issues track weekly implementation progress. They serve complementary purposes.

### Review and change management

- Meet or coordinate **at least weekly** to update issues, effort estimates and risks.
- Review a change before marking its task complete. GitHub Issues do not have a dedicated reviewer field; name the reviewer in the issue body/comment, or use a pull-request review.
- Record important technical decisions, tests, problems, individual contributions and professor feedback in `devlog/developer-diary.md`.
- Revise requirements and the Gantt chart when test results or supervisor feedback make the original estimates unrealistic.

## 5. Team Roles and Responsibilities

| Team member | Primary role | Main responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Aiswarya Payakkal Vinayan** | Software Engineering lead and development coordination | Requirements, architecture/API verification, movement tracking, map memory, frontier exploration, BFS path planning, FSM game control, safe recovery and opponent-aware reactions, software development coordination |
| **Nirmal Mohan** | Research, testing and evaluation lead | Research questions, literature review, hypotheses, experimental design, baseline tests, comparisons, results analysis |
| **Both** | Joint delivery and quality | Gantt chart and progress reviews, GitHub collaboration, integration, debugging, QA, documentation, final review and presentation |

**Review practice:** Each student reviews the other's primary deliverables. Ownership means responsibility for the work package, **not** proof that it has been completed.

## 6. Work Packages and Effort Allocation

The updated titles reflect a competition on a previously unseen map; **WP IDs, team assignments, planned dates and hours remain unchanged**. The detailed schedule is in [Project Schedule](project-schedule.md).

| WP | Work package | Responsible | Hours | Planned output |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| WP-01 | Competition requirements & rules | Aiswarya | 12 | Review objectives, host rules and competition-specific acceptance checks. |
| WP-02 | API, movement outcome & pose checks | Aiswarya | 14 | Validate DLL/API, movement failure detection and limits of relative position inference. |
| WP-03 | Map memory & confidence tracking | Aiswarya | 30 | Prototype local/persistent memory; represent uncertainty and reset on contradictions. |
| WP-04 | Frontier exploration & safe fallback | Aiswarya | 24 | Local novelty fallback, map-valid frontier detection/selection and reachability tests. |
| WP-05 | FSM, BFS, flags & opponent response | Aiswarya | 30 | Implement/test FSM state transitions, BFS known-route navigation, flag interactions and observed opponent responses. A* optional. |
| WP-06 | Unknown-map literature & hypotheses | Nirmal | 24 | Review exploration, real-time search, fair benchmarks and hypotheses; document actual reading depth. |
| WP-07 | Competition metrics & experimental design | Nirmal | 18 | Define objective detection, reliability, movement, win-rate metrics and test controls. |
| WP-08 | Held-out maps, harness & baselines | Nirmal | 24 | Build repeatable random/safe baselines on multiple maps; reserve unseen maps for evaluation. |
| WP-09 | Tournament tests & FSM/FBE ablations | Nirmal | 28 | Compare safe baseline, FBE alone, FBE+BFS and full FBE+BFS+FSM when implemented, on held-out maps/opponents. |
| WP-10 | Win-rate, robustness & validity analysis | Nirmal | 20 | Analyze win rate when observable, failures, uncertainty and between-map variation. |
| WP-11 | Schedule, review & competition briefing | Both | 12 | Update planning and prepare Week 4 research progress briefing; review feedback. |
| WP-12 | Agent integration, opponent tests & QA | Both | 34 | Integrate hybrid agent, perform host compatibility and opponent/robustness tests. |
| WP-13 | Final documentation & research report | Both | 20 | Reproduce source, test conditions, baseline comparisons and limitations. |
| WP-14 | Contingency & competition readiness | Both | 10 | Use buffer for critical defects, unknown map failures and final review. |
| | **Total** | | **300** | |

### Workload distribution

| Workstream | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Software Engineering — Aiswarya | 110 |
| Research and evaluation — Nirmal | 114 |
| Joint tasks | 76 |
| **Total team effort** | **300** |

Planned joint effort is shared equally (38 hours each), yielding **148 hours for Aiswarya** and **152 hours for Nirmal**. These are **estimates**, not work logged.

## 7. Schedule, Milestones and Dependencies

The revised Gantt chart and work-package dates are in [Project Schedule](project-schedule.md) and [`Gantt_Chart.xlsx`](Gantt_Chart.xlsx), covering **19 October 2026–31 January 2027**. Dates after the Week 3 review remain provisional.

| Milestone | Proposed timing | Expected evidence |
|---|---|---|
| M1 — Project definition | October 2026 | Requirements, initial research and Week 3 planning record |
| Week 4 progress review | **30 October 2026** | Literature findings, preliminary hybrid strategy and open questions |
| M2 — Design and baselines | November 2026 | API/movement validation, research protocol, baseline fixtures, early state design |
| M3 — Exploration and integration | December 2026 | Tested exploration/navigation prototypes, host and opponent QA |
| M4 — Competition evaluation and report | January 2027 | Held-out map comparisons, limitations and final report |

**Main dependencies:** confirm host rules and movement outcomes → implement safe local fallback and pose confidence → build map/frontier selection where reliable → add BFS for known routes → add the FSM for objective/flag/opponent/recovery decisions → run comparative competition tests → report. **Local fallback remains active even if the global-map branch fails.**

**Parallel work:** literature, metrics and baseline testing begin before advanced modules are ready. WP-09 may begin with earlier working policies while later variants are still being integrated. Tests include only implementations actually available.

The official final submission date and full competition rules require confirmation.

## 8. Research Approach and Evaluation

**Research focus:** Can an online **hybrid exploration + goal-navigation** strategy generalize to unseen competition maps better than existing movement baselines?

The revised research questions address (1) novelty/exploration on unknown maps, (2) failed movements and localization confidence, (3) value of BFS when goals are known, (4) reaction to visible opposing agents and (5) generalization to held-out maps and varied opponents.

**Preliminary approach, not a tested result:** **Frontier-Based Exploration + BFS + Finite-State Machine (FSM)**, with **safe local exploration** if map/pose confidence is insufficient. FBE selects *where* to explore, BFS decides *how* to reach a known reachable target, and the FSM decides *which game objective* has priority. A* remains an optional later comparison.

**Evaluation design:** develop multiple varied training/development maps and reserve separate unseen evaluation maps. Compare reference random, safe movement and any validated hybrid variants using consistent movement rules where possible, identical map/opponent conditions, repeated runs and documented seeds. Do not request or memorize the friend's secret competition layout.

**Early measurable outcomes:** API validity, known-obstacle requests, immediate requested reversals, decision latency and crashes. **Conditional later outcomes:** time to find an objective, verified revisits, flag deliveries, match outcomes/win rates, depending on position and host feedback. Record failed experiments and limitations.

See [Research Plan](research-plan.md), [Algorithm Comparison](algorithm-comparison.md), [Literature Summary](literature-summary.md), and [Evaluation Metrics](evaluation-metrics.md).

## 9. Software Architecture and Technical Constraints

The architecture consists of the **professor's graphical host** (not modified) and our **C++ agent DLL**, which implements:

- `Agent_GetName`
- `Agent_Create`
- `Agent_Destroy`
- `Agent_Reset`
- `Agent_Step`

The host provides a `WorldSnapshot` containing `cells[5][5]`, with the agent at local cell `[2][2]`, plus a `lastAction` value. `Agent_Create` provides map dimensions, **not absolute coordinates**. The interface defines terrain/content bitmasks, eight movement directions, waiting, picking up the flag and putting it down.

The software should separate the host-facing API adapter from observation decoding, decision policy, agent state/memory and optional pathfinding modules. **Movement requested does not necessarily mean movement succeeded**; position tracking must be verified before relying on a global map.

The DLL must be compiled for a Windows architecture compatible with the provided host. Week 1 and Week 2 sample APIs are different and must not be mixed.

See [Project Requirements](project-requirements.md) for technical constraints and acceptance checks. Architecture documentation should be maintained in [Software Architecture](software-architecture.md).

## 10. Quality Assurance and Acceptance Criteria

| Area | Evidence required |
|---|---|
| DLL/API reliability | Host loads the compiled agent; API exports and reset/destroy lifecycle function correctly. |
| Local safe movement | Fixed 5 × 5 fixtures confirm known walls/occupied cells are not chosen where excluded by policy. |
| Movement uncertainty | Deliberately blocked actions do not silently corrupt persistent map or pose; fallback is logged. |
| Unknown-map exploration | Evaluations use maps not revealed to the tested policy before the run. |
| Navigation and flags | BFS plans only through known legal traversable cells; FSM pickup/return/drop transitions require confirmed host evidence. |
| Exploration and fallback | Reachable frontiers are selected only from trusted map data; failures and contradictory observations return to safe local movement. |
| Control module | Synthetic tests cover valid FSM transitions, state reset and absence of unsupported flag-possession assumptions. |
| Competitive robustness | Different opponent policies and map layouts are used; record win/loss if the host exposes verified outcomes. |
| Research reproducibility | Agent revision, map version, opponent, random seed, trials and failures documented. |
| Documentation | README, decisions, schedule, diary and experiment reports consistent and reviewed. |

Numerical success thresholds have **not** been confirmed; establish them after initial measurements rather than inventing targets.

## 11. Risks, Mitigations and Assumptions

| Risk / uncertainty | Consequence | Planned mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Map hidden until game starts | Hard-coded routes fail | Explore online; use varied held-out maps | Both |
| Local 5 × 5 view without absolute coordinates | Map alignment unreliable | Validate move outcomes; record confidence; safe fallback | Aiswarya |
| Requested move may be rejected | Pose estimate drifts | Compare observations; treat action request as uncertain | Both |
| Unknown opponent mechanics | Incorrect tactical responses | Respond only to visible signals; confirm rules | Aiswarya |
| Secret map inadvertently used for tuning | Invalid generalization evidence | Never use final map for development; reserve independent test layouts | Nirmal |
| Different cardinal/diagonal movement sets | Unfair comparisons | Equal-direction controls; disclose differences | Nirmal |
| No reliable match score or flag telemetry | Cannot measure win rate objectively | Mark outcome metrics unavailable; use verifiable surrogate tests | Nirmal |
| Schedule overrun | Advanced features incomplete | Prioritize safe fallback, exploration and tested flags before optional A* | Both |
| DLL/compiler mismatch | Host cannot load agent | Keep Week 1/2 APIs separate; use compatible Windows toolchain | Both |
| Documentation out of sync | Conflicting claims | Weekly review, GitHub Issues, dated decision record | Both |

**Open questions:** actual move-success feedback, diagonal rules, objective visibility and flag possession, opponent combat/collision rules, how the winner is reported, map repetition/seed controls and the official submission date.

## 13. Separate Software and Research Paths (revised Week 4)

- **[Software Development Roadmap](software-development-roadmap.md):** concrete implementation stages, acceptance gates and hand-offs for FBE + BFS + FSM with safe local fallback. Aiswarya leads; both validate integration.
- **[Research Roadmap](research-roadmap.md):** literature, hypotheses, baseline controls, held-out-map experiments, ablation tests, metrics and report deliverables. Nirmal leads.
- **[FSM Design](fsm-design.md):** proposed control states, guard conditions, priorities and pseudocode.
- **[Week 4 Strategy Decision](week4-competition-strategy.md):** status, evidence, assumptions and questions to confirm.

**Decision status:** This is a proposed Week 4 research/software direction, not a claim that FBE, BFS or the FSM has been implemented or benchmarked. The existing reference agents remain unchanged.
